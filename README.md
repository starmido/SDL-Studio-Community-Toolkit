SDL-Studio-Community-Toolkit
===========

The SDL Studio Community Toolkit is a collection of helper functions. It simplifies and demonstrates common developer tasks building SDL Studio plugins.
## Supported platforms

* .NET 4.5 (Desktop / Server)
* Windows 7 / 8 / 8.1 /10 Store Apps
* SDL Studio 2017 or later

## Getting started

This libraries are build on top of SDL Studio APIs and thus using them also requires having SDL Studio installed.

1. Install Visual Studio 2013 or 2015. The community edition is available for free [here](https://www.visualstudio.com/).

2. Open the solution for an existing SDL Studio plugin or create a new one.

3. In Solution Explorer panel, right click on your project name and select **Manage NuGet packages**. Search for **Sdl.Community.Toolkit**, and choose your desired [NuGet Packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Sdl.Community.Toolkit) from the list.

4. In your C# class, add the namespaces to the toolkit, for example:

```c#
using Sdl.Community.Toolkit.Integration
```

5. Use the extensions for existing API classes.

## Nuget Packages

NuGet is a standard package manager for .NET applications that is built into Visual Studio. From your open solution choose the *Tools* menu, *NuGet Package Manager*, *Manage NuGet packages for solution...* to open the UI.  Enter one of the package names below to search for it online.

## Principles

 - Principle #1: The toolkit will be kept simple.
